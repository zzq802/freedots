Freedots allows a blind user to view a [MusicXML](http://www.musicxml.org/) file using [braille music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille_music) notation.
Playback of a complete score and individual parts via MIDI is also supported.
Additionally, minor editing functionality is included and changes are saved in MusicXML format. This makes it possible for a blind users to use freedots
together with [optical music recognition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_music_recognition) software.

There is now also a [mailing list](http://mlist.tugraz.at/mailman/listinfo/freedots) you can subscribe to.
